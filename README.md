# Driver-Distraction-and-Drowsiness-Detection-System
Developed a system that detects and generates an alarm if the driver is found to be distracted or drowsy. Built in Python using OpenCV and facial landmark detection algorithm. Also used the pre trained HarrCascades. Aimed to solve the real-world problem of increasing road accidents due to driverâ€™s distraction and drowsiness. Deployed on AWS using EC2.

To test this application, run "Driver_Cam.py" script and then click on "Driver Drowsiness Detection" option among all the available options. Upon this close your eyes for 4-5 seconds and the alarm will be generated.
